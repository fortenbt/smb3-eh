This post will look into the exact differences between PRG0 and PRG1 (left- and right-bros, respectively) that
can cause frame differences and TAS desync.

### "Left" versus "Right" Bros?

Some of you may have heard of two different copies of the Super Mario Bros. 3 cartridge existing.
When it was released in North America on February 12, 1990, the cartride purchased by consumers was
what we now call "Left Bros." or "PRG0" (program ROM 0). The NES Challenge Set was a bundled version of
the Nintendo Entertainment System that included Super Mario Bros. 3 and two controllers released in
1992. The bundled version of Super Mario Bros. 3 that came with the Challenge Set was what we now call
"Right Bros." or "PRG1" (program ROM 1).

The reason we call them "Left Bros." and "Right Bros." is fairly obvious when looking at the difference
between the box or cartidge art: the text of "BROS." is justified to the left on "Left Bros." versus
to the right on "Right Bros."
